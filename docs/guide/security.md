# Security model

[Documentation home](README.md) · Previous: [Deployment](deployment.md)

Synapse is a security tool, so its own safety model matters. These invariants are enforced in
code, not in prompts or documentation.

## Safety invariants

1. **Execute tools via argv arrays.** Tools are run with argument arrays, never a shell string.
   No target, agent, or user input is concatenated into a command. This closes the door on
   command injection through a scan target.
2. **Enforce scope and the authorization window in the execution layer.** Both are checked
   server-side, before any tool runs. This is a real chokepoint, not a single skippable hook.
3. **Secrets never enter logs, the transcript, or source.** A credential vault holds them, and
   server-side placeholder substitution keeps them out of everything a tool or a model sees.
   A shared redactor is a second line of defense on any output path.
4. **AI orchestration is a typed Go state machine.** The model proposes structured tool calls.
   Go validates and executes them. Control flow is not driven by prompts.
5. **Reports are templated from stored data.** No model sits in the report path. Analysis
   claims promote only through the judgment lifecycle, and gated capabilities need a distinct
   verifier's sealed verdict. Evidence is hash-chained. A mismatch blocks the report.
6. **The audit log is append-only.** Every action is attributable to a person or an agent id.

## Fail-closed posture

When a required capability is missing, Synapse refuses rather than degrading silently.

- No `SYNAPSE_API_TOKEN` means the server does not start. There is no anonymous access.
- The sandbox requested but Bubblewrap unavailable means startup fails, rather than running tools unsandboxed.
- A production environment without the vault key or signing seed fails to start.
- Production APIs are dispatch-only; they do not instantiate untrusted-tool runners.
- Host networking is rejected. A requested egress policy without an authoritative execution kind and ID is
  rejected before secret resolution, binary lookup, cgroup setup, or process creation.
- Production networked SCA/acquisition and CSPM fail at startup until they have trusted issuer branches. DAST
  execution workflows are omitted from production API composition. A worker-provided execution-kind string is
  never treated as authorization.
- A verification error on the evidence chain blocks the report.

## Native worker and signed-egress boundary

Production execution uses the private native EC2 tier selected in
[ADR 0008](../adr/0008-native-ec2-execution-tier.md). `synapse-worker` is a non-root systemd service with an empty
capability set, `NoNewPrivileges`, delegated cgroup v2, strict executable integrity, bounded output, shared
redaction, and an exact-runner startup check. API, web, and migration workloads remain on EKS. No execution
component uses a privileged container, broad `SYS_ADMIN`, unrestricted sudo, an SSH daemon, or a public IP.

Default network posture is an isolated namespace. For supported live recon, the trust chain is:

1. The worker resolves exact allowed domains once to canonical IPv4 addresses, compiles CIDR/port rules, and
   starts Bubblewrap blocked before the child executes.
2. A private machine-authenticated authority reloads the durable recon run and engagement, installs tenant
   context, checks current lifecycle, authorization window, scope, rules of engagement, target and tool, and
   independently derives the canonical policy. It requires exact rule equality.
3. The authority signs a short-lived Ed25519 grant binding tenant, execution kind/id, broker run ID, namespace
   slot, exact Bubblewrap PID, and exact canonical rules. The private seed remains in the control plane; the
   broker has only the public key. The authority listener has bounded request size, strict JSON, constant-time
   bearer authentication, and an authenticated fixed-window request limit.
4. The root-owned broker authenticates the caller with Linux peer credentials, validates the Bubblewrap ancestry,
   executable, private namespaces, and still-open block pipe, pins pidfd and namespace descriptors, and verifies an
   exact grant match. Its bounded `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` and `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` permit only the required read-only
   cross-UID procfs inspection; `CAP_KILL` remains absent and pidfd liveness uses poll rather than signaling.
5. Before privileged mutation, the broker fsyncs the grant ID to an append-only root-owned replay journal. A
   failed namespace setup burns the grant. Malformed permissions, partial-write uncertainty, expiry, mismatch,
   or replay fail closed.
6. The broker applies only typed canonical firewall rules to the retained namespace descriptor. The blocked child
   is released only after successful setup; setup failure kills and waits for the whole process group. Child DNS
   is unavailable and `/etc/hosts` contains the same pinned addresses used by the firewall.

The broker protocol contains no command or argv fields. It cannot authorize scope, and the worker cannot ask it
to sign rules. A compromised worker must still satisfy live control-plane authorization and an exact process- and
namespace-bound grant.

The authority is reachable only through a private TLS NLB whose frontend security group accepts the native-worker
security group. NLB egress reaches only the API backend port, and pod NetworkPolicy admits only the dedicated NLB
subnet CIDRs. The browser Ingress never exposes the listener. These controls must be validated together because
security-group identity and NetworkPolicy source behavior are different boundaries.

Broker restart recovers stale namespace/firewall state before listening. Replay state survives restart. Worker
termination is contained by queue lease fencing, per-run locks, process-group termination, systemd restart, and
ASG replacement; a stale worker cannot heartbeat or publish terminal queue state after another worker reclaims
its job.

## Access control

Per-action role-based access control runs through a single authorization chokepoint. Roles are
admin, consultant, reviewer, and read-only. Separation of duties means a machine identity can
never verify or accept its own claim. Tenant isolation is enforced at the service layer, so a
caller cannot read another tenant's engagement even if a route wrapper is bypassed.

External CI/CD integrations add a write-only encrypted credential boundary and an SSRF-resistant outbound connector. HTTPS, redirect rejection, per-dial address validation, tenant RLS, bounded responses, and exact-commit-only correlation are documented in [External CI/CD integrations](integrations.md).
## Operator identities and key revocation

Every operator has its own bearer key, so each action is attributable to a person. Key management is
`administer`-only and confined to the caller's own tenant:

```
GET   /api/v1/users                    the caller's tenant roster
POST  /api/v1/users                    provision an operator; the key is shown once
PATCH /api/v1/users/{id}               change name and role
POST  /api/v1/users/{id}/disable       revoke access, keeping the identity
POST  /api/v1/users/{id}/enable        restore access
POST  /api/v1/users/{id}/rotate-key    issue a new key; the previous one stops working at once
```

Rotate the key when one leaks: the previous key stops authenticating the moment the new one is
issued. Disable the account when a person leaves. There is no delete: an identity owns its audit,
evidence, and finding attribution, so removing the row would break the history that makes those
records provable. A disabled operator keeps its id and every past attribution; only authentication
stops.

Three rules keep this surface from becoming an escalation path.

Provisioning into a tenant other than the caller's own is refused with `403` unless the caller is
the bootstrap principal seeded from `SYNAPSE_API_TOKEN`, which is the only identity that may seed a
new tenant's first admin. There is deliberately no platform-admin role, because a role would be
assignable through this same API.

The bootstrap principal itself is not manageable through this API. It is stored with an empty
tenant, which normalizes to the default tenant, so it appears in that tenant's roster and its admins
can see it. Updating it, disabling it, and rotating its key are refused with `403` for every caller
but the bootstrap principal. Without that rule a default-tenant admin could rotate the bootstrap key,
read the new plaintext from the response, and present it to become the platform principal that every
global-resource guard tests for. Rotate the bootstrap credential by changing `SYNAPSE_API_TOKEN` and
restarting, which is the only path that moves it.

Disabling or demoting a tenant's last enabled admin is refused with `409`, so an admin cannot lock
its own tenant out.

`GET /api/v1/capabilities` is readable by any authenticated caller, including the read-only role. It
reports which optional subsystems this deployment has switched on and names the `SYNAPSE_*` variable
that controls each, never a variable's value. That is deployment topology, and it is exposed
deliberately so the dashboard can explain a disabled feature to the person looking at it rather than
showing a bare `404`.

## Browser OIDC access

Browser OIDC uses a backend-for-frontend model. The server accepts an identity only for an exact approved
issuer and subject pair, assigns it to the deployment's fixed tenant, and maps it only to the existing
allowlisted roles: `admin`, `consultant`, `reviewer`, and `read-only`. It stores the authenticated browser
state in an opaque, replica-safe server-side session and requires a session-bound CSRF token for every
state-changing request. Existing bearer-token machine authentication is unchanged. See
[ADR 0006](https://github.com/KKloudTarus/synapse-ce/blob/main/docs/adr/0006-oidc-bff-trust-model.md).

## Authorization is your responsibility

Synapse validates scope data but cannot verify legal authorization. The operator is responsible
for holding written permission to test any target. Use it only against systems you are
explicitly authorized to test.

## Offensive actions

Anything Synapse executes **against a target** is additionally governed by the offensive governance
policy in [`docs/redteam/offensive-policy.md`](https://github.com/KKloudTarus/synapse-ce/blob/main/docs/redteam/offensive-policy.md).
It is not published on this site because it is a repository artifact that CI verifies against the
machine-readable register the code enforces — the two must change together, so the reviewed text lives
next to the register rather than in the docs build.

What it settles, and what the three controls above do not:

- The categories Synapse **will not** execute at all: denial of service, destructive actions,
  exfiltration beyond a bounded proof sample, unauthorised persistence, out-of-scope lateral movement
  and third-party impact.
- Per-technique risk classification, and which class needs automatic, single or **dual** human approval.
- The rules-of-engagement fields an engagement must carry first. A missing field is a refusal.
- The kill switch: `POST /api/v1/redteam/halt` cancels all in-flight offensive work, audited with the
  operator and reason. Its stated bound covers the control plane; a technique already running on a host
  stops within one further agent poll interval.

**A technique with no register entry is refused.** The register is an allowlist.

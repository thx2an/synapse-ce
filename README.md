### Verify Everything. Trust Nothing.

**A governed control plane for the whole security-assessment lifecycle — supply chain, code,
cloud, offensive, and runtime defense.**

Turn a fragmented, manual security process into one controlled, auditable workflow: SCA, SAST,
secret and IaC scanning, reachability, recon and governed exploitation, cloud posture, and a
distributed blue-team agent fleet — all behind server-side scope enforcement, hardened tool
execution, tamper-evident evidence, and deterministic reports.

## Why Synapse

- ✅ **Deterministic first.** Scanning, matching, and reporting are pure, reproducible Go. No model sits in the report path.
- ✅ **Evidence you can trust.** Every artifact is hash-chained into a tamper-evident custody record. A broken chain blocks the report.
- ✅ **One platform, every angle.** Supply chain, code, cloud, offensive, and runtime defense behind a single gate.
- ✅ **Reachability aware.** A deterministic call graph decides whether a vulnerable symbol is actually reachable from your code.
- ✅ **Detection independent.** Owns its SBOM parsers and advisory matching, and ingests OSV, GHSA, CSAF and OVAL.
- ✅ **A detection is evidence, not an alert.** Runtime detections are attributable, hash-chained, and joined to the same asset, finding, and attack path the static pillars reason about.
- ✅ **CI ready.** `synapse-cli` is a single static binary that gates a build and emits SARIF for code scanning.
- ✅ **Safe by construction.** argv-only execution in a Linux sandbox, server-side scope and authorization before any tool runs, secrets never leave the server.

## What is Synapse

Synapse runs the whole security-assessment lifecycle behind one governed control plane, across
both point-in-time analysis (SCA, SAST, code quality, IaC) and runtime analysis (a distributed
agent fleet, eBPF detections, response actions), over container and VM estates, with a single
asset model, one authorization model, one hash-chained evidence chain, and one prioritized queue.

It is deterministic-first. Scanning, matching, license classification, scoring, and reporting are
pure, reproducible Go with nothing else in the path. Where automated analysis is offered it stays
strictly bounded: a proposal is only ever proposed, a typed Go state machine validates and
executes, scope and authorization are checked in the execution layer, secrets never leave the
server, every artifact is hash-chained into a tamper-evident custody record, and a human approves
anything intrusive.

## Features

**Software supply chain**
- **SBOM generation** across many ecosystems (npm, PyPI, Maven, Gradle, Go, Cargo, RubyGems,
  Composer, NuGet, Hex, Dart, pnpm, Poetry, yarn and more) with owned per-ecosystem lockfile parsers.
- **Vulnerability detection** from a live advisory API and an offline database, cross-correlated
  and de-duplicated, plus an owned advisory store that ingests OSV, GHSA, CSAF and OVAL for
  detection independence.
- **Risk-based prioritization** ordered by exploitability (CISA KEV, then EPSS, then CVSS), never
  by raw CVSS alone.
- **License compliance**: declared-license resolution, SPDX expression parsing, a curated category
  and risk model, and coordinate recovery for shaded or metadata-less JARs.
- **Reachability**: a deterministic call-graph engine (Go, plus JVM and JS/TS tiers) decides
  whether a vulnerable symbol is actually reachable from application code.

**Code & configuration**
- **First-party SAST**: a line-level pattern scanner for dangerous idioms (weak crypto, hardcoded
  secrets, a shell built by concatenation, an unsafe deserializer) across many languages, pinned to a
  labelled precision/recall corpus. Interprocedural and cross-file dataflow analysis is the separate
  **reachability engine**: a taint and call-graph analysis over the sandboxed `go/ssa` and tree-sitter
  graphs.
- **Secret scanning** and **IaC misconfiguration** (Terraform, CloudFormation, ARM, Kubernetes,
  Helm, Dockerfile, Compose).
- **Code quality** rules, quality gates and profiles, and third-party **SARIF ingest** into the
  same governance path.

**Offensive**
- **Recon** in a hardened sandbox, an **attack-path graph** over the asset inventory, **chained
  exploitation with per-step proof**, and **adversary emulation** with expected-detection output —
  all gated by a written offensive policy and a kill switch.
- **DAST**: authenticated crawling and a first-party check corpus with sessions from the credential vault.

**Runtime defense (blue team)**
- A distributed **agent fleet** (host and Kubernetes cluster inventory, coverage/freshness,
  signed packaging and updates) with certificate enrolment and fenced leadership.
- An **eBPF detection engine**, **detections sealed as hash-chained evidence**, a **columnar
  telemetry tier** with retention, **governed response actions** (same admission + evidence as
  exploitation), and **purple-team coverage** measured from emulation-expected vs actually-fired.

**Cloud posture (CSPM)**
- Read-only **AWS, Azure and GCP** posture connectors behind a sandboxed helper, with vault-ref
  credentials over an inherited FD, per-operation server-side authorization, and IaC-vs-live drift findings.

**Governance & evidence**
- **Tamper-evident evidence**: every artifact is hash-chained (RFC-3161 anchored); a broken chain
  blocks the report. Audit and evidence logs are append-only.
- **Hardened execution**: tools run via argv arrays inside a Linux sandbox with egress scoping;
  scope and the authorization window are enforced before any tool runs.
- **RBAC, tenant isolation (Postgres RLS), and separation of duties** through a single authorization chokepoint.
- **The Judgment primitive**: every AI/analysis claim is propose → verify → confirm; gated
  capabilities promote only on a distinct verifier's sealed verdict.

**AI analysis (optional, bounded)**
- **AI false-positive triage** grounded in deterministic evidence citations, with provider-independent
  proposer/verifier separation of duties, budgets, circuit breakers, observability, and a fail-closed
  adversarial counterfactual gate for model/prompt promotion.
- The agent proposes; a distinct verifier or a human confirms. **No model ever sits in the report path.**

**Standards & reports**
- **Standards native**: CycloneDX and SPDX with PURL, SARIF and OpenVEX exports; CSAF advisory ingestion; KEV and EPSS prioritization.
- **Deterministic reports** templated from stored data, with a curated CWE → OWASP, PCI and ISO compliance mapping.

## How it compares

Detection is at parity with the popular scanners, and sometimes ahead. On one representative
real-world repository, Synapse reported 261 unique CVEs to Trivy's 239 (235 in common) and
attached a license to 1443 packages to Trivy's 1394. Numbers move with the project, so treat
these as illustrative rather than a benchmark claim.

The lasting difference is what sits around the finding:

| Capability | Synapse | Most scanners |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SCA, license, IaC misconfig, secret scanning | Yes | Yes |
| First-party SAST (source-code rules) | Yes | Usually no |
| Reachability via a call graph | Yes | Rarely |
| Offensive: attack paths, chained exploitation, emulation, DAST | Yes | No |
| Runtime blue team: agent fleet, eBPF detections, response actions | Yes | No |
| Detections sealed as hash-chained evidence, joined to the same asset | Yes | No |
| Cloud posture (AWS/Azure/GCP), IaC-vs-live drift | Yes | Varies |
| Hash-chained, tamper-evident evidence | Yes | No |
| Server-side scope and authorization before a tool runs | Yes | No |
| RBAC, tenant isolation (RLS), separation of duties | Yes | No |
| Deterministic, model-free report path | Yes | Varies |

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.26 (pinned in `go.mod`), Node and pnpm (use pnpm, not npm or yarn).
- Syft (required for any scan) and Grype (optional, adds the offline database). `make tools`
  installs both, pinned and checksum-verified, into `./bin`.
- Docker is optional and is the easiest way to run the full stack.
- The hardened sandbox and live recon need a Linux host. Without them the API still runs
  (SCA, findings, reports); sandboxed execution fails closed rather than running unsandboxed.

### Install a released build

Grab a prebuilt binary from the [Releases page](https://github.com/KKloudTarus/synapse-ce/releases)
(Linux and macOS on amd64/arm64, and Windows on amd64) and verify it against `checksums.txt`. Each archive bundles
the packaged commands.

```bash
# Example: linux/amd64
curl -fsSL -o synapse.tar.gz \
  https://github.com/KKloudTarus/synapse-ce/releases/latest/download/synapse-ce_<version>_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf synapse.tar.gz synapse-cli
./synapse-cli scan ./path/to/project --fail-on high
```

Or scan with zero install using the container image (bundles `synapse-cli` plus syft and grype):

Container images are not published by the current release workflow. Use a release archive or build
`deploy/Dockerfile` locally when a containerized CLI is required.

Gate a repository in CI with the reusable action (see [`docs/guide/cli.md`](docs/guide/cli.md#github-action)):

```yaml
- uses: KKloudTarus/synapse-ce@v1
  with:
    fail-on: high
```

### Run the full stack with Docker

The stack has no default database password and no default API token. That is deliberate: a
credential committed to a public repository ends up in a deployment that somebody can reach, so the
Compose file fails fast rather than booting with a password an attacker already knows. Generate the
values once into `deploy/.env.local`, which `.gitignore` already covers:

```bash
umask 077
DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -hex 16)"
DB_APP_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -hex 16)"
BLOB_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -hex 16)"
cat > deploy/.env.local <<EOF
DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=$DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD
DB_APP_PASSWORD=$DB_APP_PASSWORD
BLOB_PASSWORD=$BLOB_PASSWORD
SYNAPSE_API_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
SYNAPSE_DB_DSN=postgres://synapse_app:$DB_APP_PASSWORD@postgres:5432/synapse?sslmode=disable
SYNAPSE_DB_MIGRATION_DSN=postgres://synapse_admin:$DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD@postgres:5432/synapse?sslmode=disable
EOF

docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.local \
  -f deploy/docker-compose.full.yml up -d --build --wait
```

`--env-file` is required. Compose does not read `deploy/.env.local` just because the Compose file
lives in `deploy/`. Hex passwords keep the DSNs URL-safe; percent-encode anything else.

```bash
curl localhost:8080/readyz                       # {"status":"ready",...}
open http://localhost:5173                       # dashboard
```

Paste the `SYNAPSE_API_TOKEN` from `deploy/.env.local` into the dashboard and accept the
Acceptable Use Policy. Two roles exist on purpose: `synapse_admin` owns the schema and runs
migrations, `synapse_app` serves traffic and cannot bypass row level security. PostgreSQL writes
its initial credentials into the volume, so rotating the env file afterwards does not change the
stored password; for throwaway local data, reset with
`docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.local -f deploy/docker-compose.full.yml down -v`.

Full details, including the port table and what this profile deliberately does not harden, are in
[Deployment](docs/guide/deployment.md#full-stack-with-docker-compose).

### Run natively (development)

```bash
make install                       # Go modules + web deps
make tools                         # syft + grype into ./bin
export PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH"

export SYNAPSE_API_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"   # required for operational API routes; /healthz and /readyz are public
make dev                           # API on :8080, dashboard on :5173
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>, paste the token, accept the Acceptable Use Policy. A blank
`SYNAPSE_DB_DSN` runs an in-memory dev store, so nothing is persisted. Migrations are embedded
and applied automatically at startup.

For a durable local database, start the dependency stack and point the API at it. Its one-shot
`postgres-init` container creates the application role the API connects as.

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d   # Postgres + MinIO; same as `make docker-up`
# The stack's own defaults; set these in deploy/.env to use anything else.
export DB_PASSWORD="${DB_PASSWORD:-synapse}" DB_APP_PASSWORD="${DB_APP_PASSWORD:-synapse-app}"
export SYNAPSE_DB_DSN="postgres://synapse_app:${DB_APP_PASSWORD}@localhost:5432/synapse?sslmode=disable"
export SYNAPSE_DB_MIGRATION_DSN="postgres://synapse:${DB_PASSWORD}@localhost:5432/synapse?sslmode=disable"
make dev
```

Both DSNs are needed. `synapse` owns the schema, migrates it, and grants the runtime role its
table privileges; `synapse_app` is `NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS` and is the only role the API will
serve under. Connecting as the superuser stops the API at startup with
`rls: runtime DB role cannot enforce isolation: role is SUPERUSER`, because row level security is
silently a no-op for such a role. These credentials are throwaway local defaults.

Skip `--wait` on this stack: Compose counts the exited `postgres-init` container as not running and
reports a failure even when it finished successfully. To block until the role exists, run
`docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml run --rm postgres-init`, which is idempotent.

## Command line

`synapse-cli` runs the same pipeline as the server, ideal for CI gating.

```bash
make build
./bin/synapse-cli scan ./path/to/project --fail-on high
```

The exit code is 0 when no finding meets the threshold, non-zero otherwise.

## Architecture

Clean architecture with a strict, inward-only dependency rule:

```
domain  <-  usecase  <-  adapter / infrastructure
```

All external I/O (database, tools, storage, sandbox) goes through ports, which are interfaces
in `internal/usecase/ports`. `cmd/*` is the composition root, with dependency injection in
`main` and no business logic.

## Configuration

Synapse reads its configuration from the process environment. Copy `.env.example` and adjust.
The only required variable in development is `SYNAPSE_API_TOKEN`. In production, `SYNAPSE_MEASURE_CURSOR_SECRET` is also required (generated via `openssl rand -hex 32`). See the
[configuration reference](docs/guide/configuration.md) for the full list.

Full documentation lives in [`docs/guide/`](docs/guide/README.md): introduction, installation,
quickstart, features, configuration, CLI, architecture, deployment, and the security model.
See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for what has changed.

## Roadmap

Synapse is under active development. The current roadmap extends the shipped platform rather than
introducing new pillars:

- Broader deterministic rule and ecosystem coverage beyond the current Go, JavaScript/TypeScript,
  Python, Java/JVM, .NET, Rust, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Dart, Elixir, Conda, R, Julia, and Conan coverage.
- Deeper language-aware reachability and taint analysis, with conservative handling for dynamic code.
- More model-free compliance profiles and ready-to-run CI, fleet, and deployment recipes.
- Continued hardening of sandbox, supply-chain, evidence, and agent-update boundaries.

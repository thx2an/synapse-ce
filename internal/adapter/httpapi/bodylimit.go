// http.MaxBytesReader inside this one, but nesting can only ever TIGHTEN the bound: the
// outer reader counts every byte the inner one pulls, so a handler that wraps the body in a
// larger reader still stops at the ceiling chosen here. Any route whose handler legitimately
// accepts more than defaultBodyLimit must therefore be listed in routeBodyLimits, and
// TestMultipartRoutesCarryAnUploadCeiling fails if one is not.
